My name is Emily Mallory and I am a junior in Biosystems Engineering with a specialty in Food and Bioprocessing. I am from Louisville, Kentucky, and have grown up in Kentucky all my life. I was a dancer my entire life, and continue dancing in college through some clubs and extracurricular activities. In my free time, I love to go on walks, go to the park with my friend and her dog, and pretty much anything of the outdoor nature.
